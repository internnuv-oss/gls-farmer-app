## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
* Expo Go app installed on your iOS or Android device (for physical device testing).

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gls-farmer-app.git
cd FieldCommander/Frontend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file inside the `Frontend` directory. You will need to provision projects on Supabase and Cloudinary and retrieve their respective keys.

```env
# Supabase Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Cloudinary Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your-unsigned-upload-preset
```

### 5. Run the App
Start the Metro bundler:
```bash
npx expo start
```
* Press **`a`** to open in Android Emulator.
* Press **`i`** to open in iOS Simulator.
* **Scan the QR code** with your phone's camera (iOS) or Expo Go app (Android) to run it on a physical device.

## 🗄️ Database Schema Details
The app relies on a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase. Key tables include:
1. **`profiles`**: Stores Sales Executive details (linked to Supabase Auth).
2. **`dealers`**: Stores comprehensive JSONB records for onboarded dealers (`commitments`, `scoring`, `documents`, `annexures`). 

*(Note: Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on the `dealers` table so SEs can only view and mutate their own onboarded dealers).*
